# React Hook study
A project to learn and demonstrate various React hooks

## How to start locally
1. Install node
2. Open the terminal and run: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `npm run dev`. You can access the app on port `3001`
4. When running the app, open the console on browser to see more details

## Other tools/topics that you should check
1. React devtools: debug react app on the browser
2. debugger: you should check [basic guide](https://profy.dev/article/debug-react-vscode) and [VScode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations)
3. [How browser works](https://dev.to/arikaturika/how-web-browsers-work-part-1-with-illustrations-1nid)

## Some notes
This app uses `Vite`, which is significantly faster than `create-react-app` to my experience.  
The code in this repo is a personal reference, which will inevitably contain errors.
